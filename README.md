# Image Generation from Textual Prompts

This repository contains code for generating images from textual prompts using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The code is implemented in Python using the PyTorch library.

## Introduction
Generating images from textual prompts involves training a GAN model where the generator takes both noise and textual prompts as input to generate images. The discriminator is trained to distinguish between real images and images generated by the generator. The models are trained in an adversarial manner until the generator learns to generate realistic images corresponding to the given prompts.
